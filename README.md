## Learning Outcomes and Skills Demonstrated

This repository documents my completion of the **Tata Data Visualisation: Empowering Business with Effective Insights** virtual experience. The project simulates a real‑world engagement where data analysts support senior leadership (CEO and CMO) with actionable insights built on top of an online retail dataset.

Through this program, I strengthened my skills in the following areas:

- **Data preparation and quality control**  
  - Identified and removed invalid records such as negative quantities, erroneous unit prices, and missing customer identifiers.  
  - Applied conditional logic and data transformation steps to ensure only clean, reliable data was used in the analysis.  
  - Created derived fields (for example, Revenue = Quantity × Unit Price) to support downstream reporting and KPI calculations.

- **Business‑driven analytics design**  
  - Translated high‑level executive questions into concrete analytical tasks and measurable metrics.  
  - Focused on revenue, demand, and customer value to align the analysis with strategic decision‑making for both CEO and CMO stakeholders.  
  - Prioritised clarity and interpretability so that non‑technical stakeholders can quickly understand the insights.

- **Power BI reporting and data visualisation**  
  - Built multiple report pages, each tailored to a specific business question (time‑series performance, country and customer rankings, and geographic demand).  
  - Selected appropriate visual types for each scenario, including line charts for seasonal trends, clustered/stacked bar charts for top‑N comparisons, boxplots for distribution analysis, and map visuals for regional demand.  
  - Implemented filters, top‑N logic, and exclusions (e.g., removing the United Kingdom when analysing expansion opportunities) to focus on the most relevant segments.

- **Commercial insight generation**  
  - Highlighted high‑value customers and countries contributing the most revenue and volume.  
  - Identified regions with strong product demand to inform potential market expansion strategies.  
  - Framed findings in terms of growth opportunities, customer retention priorities, and optimisation of marketing and operational efforts.

Overall, this project showcases my ability to take a raw transactional dataset, apply rigorous data cleaning, design stakeholder‑specific dashboards in Power BI, and communicate insights that directly support business decisions.
